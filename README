  BEST OF BOTH WORLDS - A TILING WINDOW MANAGER CONFIGURATION FOR FVWM


------------------------------------------------------------------------

This configuration implements some basic tiling functions to fvwm.
Otherwise the configuration is aimed at being simple and clean. 

The setup allows to switch between tiling and classical floating mode on
a per page basis. Additionally, when in tiling mode individual windows
can be set to floating (either using keyboard shortcuts or configuring
them to always be floating). 


    Current Issues
    --------------

The configuration of the menus is completely depreciated (I rarely use
them) and probably of no use to anybody.

    States used
    -----------
State 0: Toggles EdgeScroll (true if EdgeThickness 0), only applies to
         FvwmButtons
State 1: true if window is master
State 2: true if window is floating
State 3: toggles Title/!Title (true if !Title)

    Requirements
    ------------

The use of 'urxvt' is hardcoded as the default shell. Sorry! Either
install or better change code (using a variable). Further the background
console relies on 'screen'. Finally, 'stalonetray' is used as tray and
'dmenu_path' is used for the program launcher. Install or adjust. (A
recompiled-version of dmenu to match the taskbar-size is included, you
may have to compile yourself if running on another platform.)

    Customization
    -------------
The behavior of the background console is configured in the file
screenrc.bgc.

There are a number of color themes to chose from in the theme folder,
which can be easily switched in the configuration file.

By default I use a 2x2x1 desktop configuration. I.e., I have 2 desks a
2x1 pages. By default only the left page of desk 0 (the default desk)
starts in tiling mode (can be changed via an environmental variable).

Almost all of the customization is done in the main configuration file.
Just read through it. If you use vim, the folding should make it rather
organized and easy to read.
